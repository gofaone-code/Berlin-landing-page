ðŸ’„ Berlin â€” Makeup Website Landing Page

This is a simple landing page I created for a fictional makeup brand called Berlin. It's part of my early web development practice projects.

I built this project one month into learning HTML and CSS through the ITVarsity course. I received a bit of help on some of the CSS styles to get the layout and design right.

The page is built using:

HTML

CSS

Itâ€™s a single, static page and doesn't include any advanced features yet. I may update it as I learn more.
